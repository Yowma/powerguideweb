            <h3>What does PowerGuide Solutions specialize in?</h3>
            <p>PowerGuide Solutions specializes in providing power quality solutions, focusing on the distribution and installation of surge protection devices and lightning protection systems. We protect buildings and personnel from direct lightning strikes and safeguard electrical equipment from the effects of lightning currents and voltage surges.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What industries does PowerGuide Solutions serve?</h3>
            <p>We serve a wide range of industries, including broadcasting facilities, medical facilities, financial institutions, government facilities, call centers, voice and data networking, toll plazas, gas stations, and the manufacturing sector.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What are surge protection devices, and why are they important?</h3>
            <p>Surge protection devices (SPDs) are designed to protect electrical equipment from voltage spikes caused by lightning strikes, power surges, or other electrical disturbances. They are crucial because surges can damage sensitive equipment, cause downtime, and lead to costly repairs or replacements. Our SPDs help ensure the reliability and longevity of your electrical systems.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How does a lightning protection system work?</h3>
            <p>A lightning protection system provides a safe path for lightning currents to travel to the ground, preventing damage to buildings and injury to personnel. It typically includes air terminals (lightning rods), conductors, grounding systems, and surge protection devices to mitigate the effects of lightning strikes and induced surges.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What types of facilities benefit most from your solutions?</h3>
            <p>Facilities with sensitive electrical equipment or critical operations benefit the most from our solutions. For example, medical facilities rely on uninterrupted power for life-saving equipment, while broadcasting facilities need to avoid downtime. Similarly, manufacturing plants and call centers require stable power to maintain productivity and service continuity.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can PowerGuide Solutions help with both new installations and existing systems?</h3>
            <p>Yes, we provide solutions for both new installations and existing systems. For new projects, we can design and install tailored surge and lightning protection systems. For existing setups, we can assess your current infrastructure and recommend upgrades or retrofits to enhance protection and performance.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I know if my facility is at risk of power quality issues?</h3>
            <p>Signs of power quality issues include frequent equipment malfunctions, flickering lights, circuit breaker trips, or unexplained downtime. If your facility is in a lightning-prone area or relies on sensitive electronics, it may be at higher risk. We offer site assessments to evaluate your specific needs and risks.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What is the difference between surge protection and lightning protection?</h3>
            <p>Surge protection focuses on mitigating voltage spikes from various sources, such as lightning, power grid fluctuations, or internal electrical events. Lightning protection, on the other hand, is specifically designed to protect against direct lightning strikes by providing a path for the lightning current to safely reach the ground. At PowerGuide Solutions, we offer both to ensure comprehensive protection.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How often should surge protection devices be inspected or replaced?</h3>
            <p>Surge protection devices should be inspected regularly, especially after a major electrical event like a lightning strike, to ensure they are still functional. While the lifespan of an SPD varies depending on usage and exposure, we recommend a professional inspection at least once a year. Replacement may be necessary if the device has absorbed a significant surge or shows signs of wear.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Does PowerGuide Solutions provide support after installation?</h3>
            <p>Yes, we offer ongoing support to ensure your systems remain effective. This includes maintenance services, inspections, and assistance with any issues that arise. Our team is committed to helping you maintain reliable power quality over the long term.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Are your solutions compliant with industry standards?</h3>
            <p>Yes, our surge protection devices and lightning protection systems are designed to meet international and local standards for safety and performance. We ensure that our products are suitable for the specific requirements of the industries we serve.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">

        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What should I do if my facility experiences a lightning strike?</h3>
            <p>If your facility is struck by lightning, first ensure the safety of all personnel. Then, inspect your electrical systems for damage and check if your surge protection devices have been activated or need replacement. Contact PowerGuide Solutions for a post-strike assessment to evaluate your systems and recommend any necessary repairs or upgrades.</p>
        </div>
